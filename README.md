# About Me
I am a recent graduate from the University of Manchester with a BEng (Hons) Mechanical Engineering degree. During my time at university, I had found myself gravitating toward data acquisition, handling and the manipulation of data to provide insights, analytics and to use in pipelines for increased automation. As such, my introduction to machine learning had fascinated me, opening my eyes to the possibilites with using large data structures to be able to predict outcomes, quantities and possibilities in all areas of application. As such, this only paved the way for my aspirations for a promising data science career.

This repository is made to store and showcase my completed machine learning projects, as well as any other relevant material.
